# Medium Blog Formatting Guide for Amazon Q Developer Pro Setup

## 📝 Medium-Specific Formatting Tips

### Code Blocks in Medium
Medium automatically formats code when you:
1. Use triple backticks (```) 
2. Or indent with 4 spaces
3. Or use the code block button in the editor

### Headers and Styling
- Use `#` for main headers
- Use `##` for section headers  
- Use `###` for subsections
- **Bold text** with `**text**`
- *Italic text* with `*text*`

## 🖼️ Image Placement Strategy

### Image 1: Architecture Overview
**📍 Placement:** After the introduction paragraph, before "Understanding the Amazon Q Architecture"

**Caption Suggestion:**
> "The four pillars of Amazon Q Developer Pro: Identity Center, Builder ID, Q Business Application, and Web Experience working together"

### Image 2: Problem vs Solution
**📍 Placement:** Before "Step-by-Step Implementation Guide" section

**Caption Suggestion:**
> "From activation token confusion to a clear, systematic approach - the transformation every developer needs"

### Image 3: Success Results  
**📍 Placement:** After "Real-World Implementation" section, before "Key Insights"

**Caption Suggestion:**
> "Mission accomplished! All components active and ready for AI-powered development"

## 📱 Medium Mobile Optimization

### Text Formatting
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max)
- Use bullet points and numbered lists
- Add plenty of white space
- Use emojis sparingly but effectively

### Code Block Best Practices
```bash
# Keep commands on separate lines
aws configure set aws_access_key_id YOUR_KEY
aws configure set aws_secret_access_key YOUR_SECRET

# Add comments to explain complex commands
aws qbusiness create-application \
  --display-name "Your-App-Name" \    # Your app display name
  --identity-type "AWS_IAM_IDC"       # Use Identity Center
```
